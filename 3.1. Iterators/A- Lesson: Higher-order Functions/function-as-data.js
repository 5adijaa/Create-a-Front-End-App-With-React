// Weâ€™ve defined a function with a very long name: checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes. This function takes a long time to execute. It checks whether 2 + 2 = 4, but it does it a million times (just to be really sure)! Create a shorter-named variable, is2p2 that will be easier to work with, and assign checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes as its value.
// Hmmm, if we forgot the original name of our function, is there a way we could figure it out? Use is2p2 to console.log() the name property of the function we assigned to is2p2.
